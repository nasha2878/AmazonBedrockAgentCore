Context:

In Part 19, we  built and deployed:
A multi-tool AgentCore Gateway

Today we will focus purely on consumption – 
Learn how an agent calls the gateway dynamically to make a tool call 
Create an external client that calls that agent

Python Client (EC2)

AgentCore Agent (Docker Runtime with LLM)

   | IAM Role / API Key (depending on the tool)

Tool Call


Scenario:

Build a Smart Field Operations Agent with Client Integration

Imagine a Field Operations Manager using a client app to interact with your agent:

Ask the agent in plain language for weather updates at any location.
Automatically resolve locations via LocationIQ.
Push summary alerts to Slack so the team is instantly informed.

The client serves as the interface, sending natural language requests to the agent, which orchestrates multiple tools behind the scenes turning multi-step operational tasks into a single seamless workflow

Your agent should be able to respond to user prompts that require multiple tools to respond and take action :

Get the coordinates for Berlin and send them to #social
What is the current weather in Tokyo? Send it to #mylab
Get the coordinates for Madrid, then get the weather for those coordinates, then send a short summary to #social
