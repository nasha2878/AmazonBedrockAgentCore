agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"What did we learn from this debugging process that would apply to similar AgentCore issues in the future?"}'

agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"Confirm whether this debugging session was successful and explain why."}'

agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"Let me summarize what we actually did in this debugging session: First, we noticed a problem with episodic memory not being written. Then we checked the memory IDs, confirmed STM events were working, and verified that durable namespaces were configured. After that, we tested multiple prompts to see if the episodic strategy was triggered. Finally, we confirmed the runtime was working and started thinking about why episodic extraction might still be quiet."}'
